Deadline
========

Simple page for adding, deleting and viewing course deadlines.

Absolutely no security features in place, relies on a trust system for people not to abuse.

For live example of site check out [http://ohjann.netsoc.ie](ohjann.netsoc.ie).

How To Use
-----------
Download and copy files into your webserver or preferably `git clone git@github.com:Ohjann/Deadline.git`

Webpage requires a .txt file as the backend called data.txt with each deadline seperated by a new line in the format:
`Subject - Date - Time`

File can be empty as each entry can be added through the web interface.
